# AgriWasteSort
AgriWasteSort (Agricultural Waste Classification System) by using Python, TensorFlow, MobileNetV2, OpenCV, CNN, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ImageDataGenerator.
i) Built a deep learning-based image classification system to categorize agricultural waste as Biodegradable (Reusable) or Non-Biodegradable (Recyclable) using transfer learning with MobileNetV2.
ii) Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with custom top layers for binary classification on a structured dataset of agricultural waste images.
iii) Used ImageDataGenerator for image preprocessing, normalization, and batch generation; applied data rescaling and augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
iv) Integrated OpenCV for real-time prediction via webcam and image overlays, displaying classification and confidence scores on captured frames.
