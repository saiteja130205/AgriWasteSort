# AgriWasteSort
AgriWasteSort (Agricultural Waste Classification System) by using Python, TensorFlow, MobileNetV2, OpenCV, CNN, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ImageDataGenerator.

i) Built a deep learning-based image classification system to categorize agricultural waste as Biodegradable (Reusable) or Non-Biodegradable (Recyclable) using transfer learning with MobileNetV2.

ii) Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with custom top layers for binary classification on a structured dataset of agricultural waste images.

iii) Used ImageDataGenerator for image preprocessing, normalization, and batch generation; applied data rescaling and augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

iv) Integrated OpenCV for real-time prediction via webcam and image overlays, displaying classification and confidence scores on captured frames.

v) Can be implemented in PyCharm IDE and the dataset used for this classification was Waste Classification Dataset (22,500 images) from Kaggle.
